==================

Slides for my talk at BFPG, based on Brent Yorgey's Haskell course, lecture 7 (Monoids and folds)

Abstract
--------
We've seen how a list can be aggregated into a single value using folds. This lecture explores how we might create similar folds for our own data structures; yet another example of how higher-order functions save us from repeating ourselves. The lecture will also explore monoids, one of Haskell's most prevalent typeclasses.
