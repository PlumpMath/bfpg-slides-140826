-- Take-away points:
--
-- 1. Monoids show up everywhere and knowing about this 
--    typeclass means we won't have to repeat ourselves.
-- 2. Tuples of monoids enable us to build up more 
--    complex behaviour from simpler monoids, resulting
--    in code which is easier to reason about, and often 
--    more efficient.
